# D-VOTE

D-VOTE is a decentralized voting system based on ethereum blockchain. E-voting is a trending, yet critical topic related to the online services.

The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in
development of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use electronic voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable blockchains, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic.

An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees.
